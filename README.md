# DatePickerComponent
This project is a reusable date picker component built with React and Next.js, designed to allow users to select recurring dates similar to the feature found in the TickTick app. The date picker supports various recurrence patterns (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly) and offers customization options for fine-tuning the recurrence.
